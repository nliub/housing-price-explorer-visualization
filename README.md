Our team includes Sophia Chen, Nicole Liu, Sneha Narain and Omkar Salpekar. We used Python Altair library and Tableau to create helpful visualization to explain the "why," where" and "when" of buying a house in the U.S.

Data from this website are sourced from the Redfin Data Center. The time range of our data is: 2017 - June 2023. The data were computed on a rolling 4-week window, grouped by metropolitan area and by county.
